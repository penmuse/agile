<p>
If your background is deeply rooted in software development then the word Agile won't be novel. If you're not, you probably might have heard it somewhere but if you still haven't then do rest assure I will do my best to explain the word from both its lexical and software context.

</p>

<h3>Agile a brief overview</h3>

<p>
Outside the context of software development, the word Agile has correlations with quick, smart, clever, well-coordinated, lively, active, lithe, etc. (see agile definition) but in the context of Software Development, Wikipedia puts it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
Agile software development is a set of principles for software development in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing,cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
</blockquote>
<cite>Wikipedia</cite>

<p>
From the above definition the key takeaways are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adaptive Plannig</li>
<li>Early delivery a.k.a providing better estimates</li>
<li>Continuos Improvement( geared towards qualtiy)
<li>Be more in control</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works in practice</h3>

<p>
The Agile approach to developing software is simply straightforward. Say we want to build an app using the agile scrum methodology we can start by:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Breaking down all the features of our app into the self-contained unit and dump them in the backlog. A backlog is a list containing all sub-parts of our app in order of priority. This list is sometimes called user stories.This story tells you what a user should be able to do with your app.</li>
	
<li>
From the backlog we pick the task with the highest priority to start with.
</li>

<li>
	Begin working on this task and when done, we inform necessary stakeholders.
</li>

<li>After this has been accomplished, step two through three is repeated.</li>
</ol>
 
<h3>Applying this concept to life</h3>

<p>
You can apply the agile methodology to different areas of your life. For instance, one thing I do every morning before I set out for work, is to make sure I have at least three(3) goals I would like to achive for that day. I don't do this when I get to work, I do it before I leave for work. </p>

<h3>Breaking down the goal</h3>


My goal for a certain day could be something like 

<ul>
<li>Write test for my authorization script</li>
<li>Fix deployment bug on team project</li>
<li>Take cousera course on Public Speaking</li>

</ul>

<p>I then go further, and make a checklist of all those goals in order of priorities and allocate the appropriate time frame to each. Since I know I spend 8 hours at work, I then know how to split this time among this task. So, I usually end up with a table like this:</p>

<table border="1">

	<tr>
		<th colspan="2">Goal</th>
	   <th>Time</th>
	   <th>Done</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>
		Write test for my authorization script
		</td>
		
		<td>
		  2 hours
		</td>
		
		<td>
		   <input type="checkbox" />
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>
		Fix deployment bug on team project
		</td>
		
		<td>
		  3 hours
		</td>
		
		<td>
		   <input type="checkbox" />
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>
		Take cousera course on Public Speaking (week 2)
		</td>
		
		<td>
		  2 hours
		</td>
		
		<td>
		   <input type="checkbox" />
		</td>
	</tr>
	
</table>

<h4>What happens if time elapsed?</h4>

<p>
If I am yet to achieve a specific goal after its timeframe elapses, I move on to the next thing on my list. 
Don't spend way too much time when you have a blocker. Move on to something else, and see if you can delegate that task. After you must have done with the current task, come back and give it a try. </p>

<p>I leave you with a video from Bruce Felier on how to apply agile methodology to your personal life. </p>
